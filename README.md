# Youtube-cli
Youtube CLI programm to download music.

## First step

Download the `youtube-cli`. Link: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl

## Shell scripts

Download my shell scripts and set aliases for them. One is for a particular song and one for a whole playlist. You furthermore get asked for a download format of the song / songs. I always choose between `mp3` and `wav`.

**Tipp:**  
I stored them in my terminal home folder as hidden files (`.` in front of the name. --> `.youtube.sh`)
